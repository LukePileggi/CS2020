## 3. The Assessment

**Table 1.** Description of the assessment components for SL and HL

| Assessment Component                    | Weighting SL | Weighting HL |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Paper 1: (1 h 30 min)                   | 45%          | 40%          |
| Paper 2: Option (1 h)                   | 25%          | 20%          |
| Paper 3: Case Study (1 h)               | -            | 20%          |
| Internal Assessment (IA): (30 h)        | 30%          | 20%          |
